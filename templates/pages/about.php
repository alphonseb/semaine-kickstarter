                <p>
                    Ten Thousand Islands is a new sneaker brand from Manchester, launching in 2019.

                </p>
                <p>
                    We have been really busy developing our first sneakers « Freestate » :
                    water-friendly travel shoes that can be worn every day !

                <h3>Our ambition</h3>
                <p>
                    Freestate are shoes created for hot summer days and cool summer nights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can wear Freestate in and out of the water, it is quick drying, ultra-lightweight, created to fit each foot’s shape and smart enough for any occasion.

                <h3>Our inspiration</h3>
                <p>
                    We give the upmost importance to our origins, in fact we hold them dear. You can always find something to do in Manchester, whether you just want to contemplate art in the Richard Goodall Gallery or just go for a drink : the choice is endless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of our greatest inspirations when we
                    created Freestate was, you guessed it, the climate of Manchester. It is so changing, so diverse that it made us wonder : what if we could create a sneaker that could be used in any circumstance ?
