  <div class="firstInfo">
    <p>
      We chose exclusively light materials to help speeding up the drying process and to allow your foot to feel free and flexible while remaining cool and light at any temperature. Freestate only weighs 200g, which is less than a french baguette !

  <div class="secondInfo">
    <p>
      Freestate is composed by a lot of small holes that allows them to dry much faster than regular sneakers. Thatâ€™s the secret of our every day shoe : the air is constantly renewed inside the shoes which allows them to stay light in and out of the water.
